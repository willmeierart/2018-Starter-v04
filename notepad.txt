personal code-style points of improvement:
  [] don't forget semantic html
    [] also image alt's, other aria-type html props
  [] use proptypes
  [] clear comments in complex parts
    [] likewise document process alongside creating it
  [] use more robust debugging practice than just console logs everywhere
  [] move toward TDD



need to update README
