personal code-style points of improvement:
  - [] don't forget semantic html
    - [] also image alt's, other aria-type html props
  - [] use proptypes
  - [] figure out how to use ChildFactory for transitiongroup
  - [] clear comments in complex parts
    - [] likewise document process alongside creating it
  - [] use more robust debugging practice than just console logs everywhere
  - [] move toward TDD

TODO:
  - [] next time you launch a project, refactor all initial issues so this just works out of the box
  - [] try to implement [next-offline](https://github.com/hanford/next-offline)
  - [] when 6.0 comes out refactor to expose app.js
  


need to update README
