# 2018 Agency Zero FrontEnd Starter v04.1

## A modern web-dev standard for AZ projects
### a constant work in progress, updated with every project...

This iteration uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) - an isomorphic/universal/SSR framework on top of React v16 for the fastest page loads and best SEO possible in a modern dev architecture. Its configuration is setup for integration with a headless [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) GraphQL backend.

Other features include:
- Apollo 2 as a GraphQL client
- Redux for internal state management, with various reducers for setting user platform type state
- an express server config for custom-routed pretty URLs
- custom webpack, babel, and postcss configs for various optimizations
- Sass (and pre/post-css webpack config) as an optional global fallback to Next's default 'Styled-JSX'
- prepared HOC's for animation with both react-motion and react-transition-group
- underpinnings of testing suites in both Jest and Chai
- underpinnings of docker integration for quick deployment
